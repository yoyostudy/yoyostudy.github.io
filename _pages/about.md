<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I'm a 1st year PhD student in Computer Science at Simon Fraser University, fortunate to be supervised by Dr. [Linyi Li](https://cs.sfu.ca/~linyi/) in the [Trustworthy AI (TAI) Lab](https://sfu-tai.github.io/). 

My primary research interest lies in the theoretical foundations of model structure, interpretability, learning algorithms, and reinforcement learning. At the same time, I care about socially responsible AI in practice, with applications in red teaming, safety, and AI governance.

# 🔥 News
- *2025.06*: &nbsp;🎉🎉 Participated in a hackathon with developers from my team at SAP about AI model governance.
- *2026.01*: Completed PhD coursework and breadth exam requirements.

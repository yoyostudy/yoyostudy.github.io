<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I'm a 1st year PhD student in Computer Science at Simon Fraser University, fortunate to be supervised by Dr. Linyi Li. 

My research spans theory and practice: focusing on model structure, trustworthy AI, and reinforcement learning in theory, and on socially responsible AI—covering red teaming, safety, and social impacts in practice.
